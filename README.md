# polytree

polytree is a framework that makes it easy to
instantiate the kind of high-performance tree-based
concurrent ordered maps (things with interfaces
like that of Masstree) at the heart of FOEDUS.

polytree, as with the rest of the FOEDUS project,
is released under the GPLv2 license with the HP
"Classpath exception" clause (see LICENSE.txt).
