# polytree

polytree is a lock-free ordered-map framework for handling synchronization 
on tree-based ordered dictionaries, with the expectation that it will be
integrated into FOEDUS as a central storage structure upon maturity.

polytree, as with the rest of the FOEDUS project,
is released under the GPLv2 license with the HP
"Classpath exception" clause (see LICENSE.txt).
